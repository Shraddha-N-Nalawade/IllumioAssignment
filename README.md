# IllumioAssignment

## Overview
This is a Maven Project in Java published as a library. This library will check if a Url is valid or not and throw error if there are three consecutive invalid urls. The program which will use this library can prompt user for invalid url and can close the session of exception is thrown.

## Design
We are using static Map to store all the urls and whether it is valid or not in memory.

## Test
The project is tested using JUnit Test cases. Total 28 TestCases are created.

## Future changes
Create separate Exception class for closing session.
